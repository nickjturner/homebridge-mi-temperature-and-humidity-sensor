<p>The Homebridge Mi Temperature and Humidity Sensor plugin allows you to add your Mi Sensor from HomeKit with
  <a href="https://homebridge.io">Homebridge</a>. 
</p>

## Compatibility

The LYWSD03MMC sensor is currently the only supported sensor for this plugin.

Before starting the installation you will have to flash the sensor to remove the encryption.

There are several ways to do this, but I recommend using this [flashing tool](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html) (This tool is not made by or supported by me).

For the BLE connection look at the noble [prerequisites](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#prerequisites) for your OS.

## Installation

### With [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x)
  1. Search for "homebridge-mi-temperature-and-humidity-sensor" on the plugin screen.
  2. Click **Install** on `homebridge-mi-temperature-and-humidity-sensor`
  3. Give the sensor a useful name. (This will appear in the HomeKit app).
  4. Add the MAC address. This can be found by using the above flashing tool, or by running `bluetoothctl scan le` from the terminal. The address will start with `A4:C1:38`.
  5. Restart Homebridge to pick up the new accessory.
  6. Repeat with as many sensors as you want.

### From Terminal
  1. Run the following to install the plugin:
  ```
  sudo npm i -g homebridge-mi-temperature-and-humidity-sensor@latest
  ```
  2. The config should look like:
  ```
  "accessories": [
      {
          "accessory": "MiSensor",
          "name": "Living Room Mi Sensor",
          "address": "a4:c1:38:b9:3f:72"
      }
  ]
  ```
  3. `name` should be a useful name for the sensor. (This will appear in the HomeKit app).
  4. `address` is the device MAC address. This can be found by using the above flashing tool, or by running `bluetoothctl scan le` from the terminal. The address will start with `A4:C1:38`.
  5. Restart Homebridge to pick up the new accessory.
  6. Repeat with as many sensors as you want.

## Troubleshooting

I've tested this plugin on a Raspberry Pi 4, Pi Zero W and a MacBook Pro running Monterey. It should work on other systems, but let me know if there are any issues.

If you are having any problems open an issue in this repo and I will try to help.

## Future Development

I'm planning an update that will remove the requirement for flashing, but I'm having some issues with the bluetooth on my Pi 4 which is slowing down any progress.
